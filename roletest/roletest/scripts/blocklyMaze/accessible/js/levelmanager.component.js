    <h2>Page Layout</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Blockly Music Game! On this page is a music puzzle game
    you will complete using AccessibleBlockly. There are three levels to this
    game.</p>
    <p>This page has several instruction sections followed by the game area.
    All sections have a level 2 heading associated with them. The
    ‘Screen Reader Settings and Compatilibity’ section (directly after this
      section) describes the best screen reader/browser combinations to use for
    AccessibleBlockly and what settings to use. The ‘Navigation’ section
    describes how to use your keyboard to navigate in the AccessibleBlockly game
     area. The ‘Level Goal’ section tells you the objective of the level you are
      on. You are currently on level {{level}}. The ‘Hints’ section will be available if
       the level has any hints associated with it. Any extra tips or reminders
       will be in the ‘Hints’ section.</p>
    <p>Following this are three buttons: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.
    When you begin the game, the buttons for Level 2 and Level 3 will be
    disabled, as you will begin automatically on Level 1. As you complete each
    level, the next level’s button will be enabled for you.</p>
    <p>Next is the AccessibleBlockly game area. This area is two columns with
    the ‘Toolbox’ section on the left and the ‘Workspace’ section on the right.
    The ‘Toolbox’ section has a collection of blocks of code. These blocks can
    be moved to the workspace and put together to make code! Putting the right
    blocks together in the workspace will help you complete the level. The
    workspace area has two buttons: ‘Run Code’ and ‘Clear Workspace’. When you
    think you’ve completed the level, hit the ‘Run Code’ button. When you’ve
    switched to a new level, make sure to use the ‘Clear Workspace’ button to
    remove all blocks from your workspace.</p>
    <h2>Screen Reader Settings and Compatibility</h2>
    <p>AccessibleBlockly is best experienced using Firefox with NVDA or Jaws.
    Turn the punctuation setting to ‘all’ and ensure that you are in focus mode
    while navigating the game area.</p>
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>The game area is split into two sections: The Toolbox and the Workspace.
    Use the tab key to navigate to the Toolbox. Tab and Shift+Tab are also the
    best ways to navigate between the Toolbox, ‘Run Code’ button, ‘Clear
    Workspace’ button, and the Workspace.</p>
    <p>The Toolbox and the Workspace are both nested lists, much like a table of
     contents. The outer-most list item will be a block summary that reads out
     the block contents to you. Sublists like the block action list will allow
     you to copy, paste and do other actions to the block. Other sublists will
     read you specific details about the block or allow you to change parts of
     the block.</p>
    <p>Navigating the nested list structure uses exclusively the arrow keys.
    If you are at item A (level 2 item 2) in the Toolbox and you hit the up or
    down arrows, you will move up and down the list A is in (level 2 item 3, or
      level 2 item 1, for instance). If you hit the left arrow, you will be
    taken back to the parent list item of A (e.g. the level 1 item that has A
      as a sublist item). Hitting the right arrow will take you to the first
    sublist item of A (level 3 item 1).</p>
    <p>Feel free to play around in the Toolbox a bit to understand how the
    navigation works.</p>
